# Mergesort

Implement an iterative (no recursive calls) and in-place version of mergesort.
Use the template I've provided in `code.js`. Test your new function; I've
provided some basic testing code that uses
[jsverify](https://jsverify.github.io/) in `code.test.js`.

Hint: To make merge sort in-place, think about what happens during the merge --
where are elements moved to and from? To make it iterative, think about the
part of the array each recursive call considers.

## Runtime Analysis

Analyse the time complexity of your implementation and give a $\Theta$ bound for
its worst-case runtime. Add your answer, including your reasoning, to this
markdown file.

## My Response

I feel like the analysis should be the same as normal at $\theta(nlogn)$ but that doesn't seem right, because since it's not recursive it's not doin the same thing as a regular mergesort, and since it's running through four different loops in the worst case scenario I feel like it should be $\theta(n^4)$ because for larger arrays this iterative, in-place mergesort would be very inefficient and slow.
